	Title: <b>Systems with hidden attractors 	</b><br>
	Abstract: “Hidden attractor” is a new definition and the presence of hidden attractors in dynamical systems in important not only in academic community but also in practical problems. In this presentation, I will introduce about systems with hidden attractors, my researches and some obtained results.	</p>

	Title: <b>Gender equality in family relations of Vietnamese living in Vietnam and Poland 	</b><br>
	Abstract: Gender equality is an important aspect of a happy family. It is expressed in equality of tasks sharing, decisions related to organization of family life, equal treatment of daughters and sons etc. The main aim of the study was to look at the effect of immigration on the perception of gender equality. Respondents of this study were 196 Vietnamese living in Vietnam (100 persons) and Poland (96 persons). Methods of the study included: the purposely designed questionnaire administered to all participants and the intensive interview conducted with 14 Vietnamese who got married with Poles. Two types of family relations are the main focus of the paper: a relation between spouses and between parents and offspring. The results indicate equality of husbands and wives in work and economic aspects, as both work outside the house and contribute financially. Although participants overtly confirmed the equality of children of both genders, but in particular situations they still expressed some preference for sons. Such pattern of results is confirmed both groups of participants. 	</p>

	Title: <b>The growth characterisrics of fish species -Gerres filamentosus (Cuvier, 1829) in coastal zone, Quang Binh province	</b></br>
Abstract: The research results were made from October, 2013 to March, 2014 using the method being applied in the current study ichthyology of GV Nikolski, Pravdin IF, OF Xakun, NA Buskaia and Mai Dinh Yen, fish samples were collected in the coastal area of Quang Binh province. The study results showed that Gerres filamentosus (Cuvier, 1829) has length range from 52mm - 230mm, corresponding to a volume of 4g - 185g. Age structure of the fish simple, consisting of four age groups (0+ - 3 +), the annual growth rate is relatively fast, the Von Bertalanffy growth equation of form Lt = 234.4 x [1- e-0.35 (t + 0.996)], Wt = 373.4 x [1-e-0.0244 (t + 0.2388)] 3.0676.

	Title: <b>Music analysis module in a multiplatform game	</b></br>

Abstract:
Fractality is a 2D, multiplatform game that has been the centrepiece of our
bachelor's thesis. Created using the Unity 3D engine, it features a player
evading enemies represented by fractals. Its main objective is to complete
levels by surviving continuously for the whole length of a music piece
chosen by the player.

The project's key point was to detect beats in a given background track and
wire them to visual reactions of in-game entities.

In this presentation we will focus on steps needed to implement a sound
analysis module that relies on the Fast Fourier Transform algorithm and
describe the overall process of Fractality's creation.

	Title: <b>The effects of fullerenes on amyloid beta fibrils	</b></br>
	Abstract: 
Alzheimer's Disease are believed to be associated with amyloid beta fibrils, which accumulate as plaque inside the brain and are composed of amyloid beta. In this study we use docking and molecular dynamics simulation methods to investigate the interactions of some fullerenes to some kinds of amyloid beta fibrils. We showed that the binding free energy between fullerene and amyloid beta fibril is linearly decreased with the size of the fullerene. Fullerene bind stronger to more mature fibrils than to the immature one; however, It lets more water molecules to penetrate into the hydrophobic center of the immature than into the mature. C60, to a greater extent in comparison with other fullerenes, is the most probable of destabilizing the structure of immature fibril. Our study revealed that the van der Waals interaction dominates over the electrostatic interaction and non-polar residues of amyloid beta peptides play the significant role in interaction with fullerenes providing novel insight into the development of drug candidates against Alzheimer’s disease.

	Title: <b> Coarse-grained modeding of biosystems	</b></br>

Abstract:

The description of biosystems by all-atom models is accurate but 
computationally very time consuming. One of reasonable approaches
to overcome this difficulity is to 
reduce complexity of studied systems by using coarse-grained models.  
In this talk I present simple lattice models to capture the kinetics of protein
aggregation which is important for understanding neurodegenerative diseases.
We have shown that aggregation rates are controlled by hydrophobicity, charge and population of the so called fibril-prone state of monomer. The impact of crowded environment will be also discussed.

	Title: <b> How to prepare a scientific paper?	</b></br>
	Abstract:
In general, the results of a research should be accessible to the scientific community as published articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals. The task of writing a scientific paper and submitting it to a journal for publication is a time‐consuming and a quite heavy task. The purpose of this talk is to give a few simple suggestions especially for graduated and Ph.D. students for writing and submitting manuscripts to the scientific journals.

	Title: <b> Ions and disordered proteins	</b></br>
	Abstract:
Ions, including transition metal ions, interact with proteins. The structural and catalytic functions exerted by ions in ordered proteins is now well investigated by x-ray crystallography, NMR and other techniques. Less is known about the role of ions in proteins that are intrinsically disordered in the monomeric state, while they form stable assemblies in the presence of cofactors, concentrated in particular environments or when they interact with other macromolecular partners. In this lecture I shall summarize some modeling and experimental techniques that are suitable to investigate this still obscure area of biology.

        Title: <b> 3D Geochemical block modeling of the IOCG SinQuyen Deposit, North VietNam: Implication for resources evaluation  </b></br>
        Abstract:

The Sin Quyen deposit is iron oxide copper and gold rich rare earth elements and uranium deposit (IOCG-REE-U), located in the Proterozoic Sin Quyen metamorphosed sedimentary formation and strongly controlled by inverse Sin Quyen fault, parallel to the Red River faults system of North Vietnam. This deposit is much complex for making a probabilistic geochemical modeling as well as 3D (digital geostructural modeling) geometric models by traditional methods. In this study, A novel 3D geochemical block modeling is presented with applied know-ledges and computational tools approach to construct 3D geometric models of geochemistry, ore-bodies and intrusions suitable in situ. The methodology consists of ﬁve steps: (1) modeling of ore-bodies thickness using ordinary radioactive geophysical data on surface and in boreholes; (2) making up blank block modeling within and cover modeling of ore-bodies above and all boreholes; (3) analysis of major/trace elements content and modeling of ore-bodies within blank block model base on cores geochemical results; (4) modeling of geochemistry in different grades; (5) modeling of geochemistry and lithology imply estimations of ores resources in this region. The model show almost ore-bodies are hydrothermal vein-type and the modeling base on geophysical and geochemical data is common, implied a relation between radioactive with ore elements. Gold contribute in high grade copper place while uranium and rare earth elements go together located in almost copper ore-bodies. Combination geochemical and lithological modeling have allowed estimation of different elements reserves. The results indicate that: some ore-bodies are continuous at depth and potential exploration targets of their continuations extend downward from their present mining levels.

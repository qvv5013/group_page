                            Our focus has been on uncovering key factors that govern protein self-assembly. We have
                            shown that the beta structure and the population of the so-called fibril-prone conformation
                            in the monomeric state are related to the rate of fibril formation. Based
                            on the amyloid cascade hypothesis, the aggregation of full-length and truncated amyloid beta
                            (Aβ) peptides is investigated to understand the molecular mechanism of Alzheimer's disease.
                            The structural properties of the monomer
                            and oligomers of alpha-synuclein are being studied in connection with Parkinson's disease.

                            Ribosome is a molecular machine for protein synthesis which consists of four phases of
                            translation - initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling. This process is an
                            area of intense research due to the essential role of proteins to life.
                            For many decades, protein folding research has been dominated by the assumption that
                            thermodynamics determines protein structure and function. However, recently accumulated
                            evidence has supported the emerging paradigm of non-equilibrium
                            control of protein behavior. Namely, speed of synthesis of proteins in the ribosome greatly
                            influences their properties, mRNA sequence evolution, and protein aggregation in bulk
                            related to diseases. One of the main goals is
                            explore how changes in codon translation rates affect the protein oligomerization and
                            aggregation in bulk.

                            Experimental studies observed that amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers are the main pathogenic
                            structures including effects on cognition inhibition, tau hyperphosphorylation and cellular
                            membrane permeabilization. Oligomers can form pore in the membrane which
                            can allow metal ions to pass through a membrane leading to neurotoxicity. In addition, these
                            channels can cause disrupted cellular homeostasis, induce reactive oxygen species
                            production, alter signaling pathways, and mitochondrial
                            dysfunction. These results indicate that the molecular interaction nature between Aβ
                            oligomers and membrane is the intriguing object to shed light on the mechanism of
                            Alzheimer’s disease. We hypothesize that, since Aβ oligomers
                            are more toxic than mature fibrils, they should affect membranes to a greater extent than
                            the latter. We use MD simulations to check this hypothesis. In addition, we study the effect
                            of metal ions such as Cu2+ and Ca2+ on the
                            Aβ-membrane interactions.
